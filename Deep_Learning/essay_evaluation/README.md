# NLP approaches competition  

This project is dedicated to the evaluation of various model architectures for a specific NLP task.  
It is based on [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-agency-lab-automated-essay-scoring-2/overview) but goes far beyond.  
It is dedicated to the Natural Language Processing problem: marking of essays. I tested various approaches starting from prediction score by length, to boosting, custom neural nets, BERT, and modern LLM.  
I hope you will find it interesting, and thank you for checking!
