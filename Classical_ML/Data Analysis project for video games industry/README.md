Data analysis project for video games industry  
**Games analysis**  
**Aim:** To analyze the popularity of games in relation to the available parameters as well as users’ preferences.  
**Description:** Available data containing information about games and their success and sales on different platforms was carefully pre-processed: outliners and missing values were handled. With exploratory data analysis and heavy usage of data-visualization trends in sales, like average platform and game lifetime, distribution by genre, the impact of users and critics' scores on sales were analyzed, taking into account geographical preferences. Users’ portraits for geographical regions were made, revealing genre and violence rating preferences. Several hypotheses like PC or console preferences were tested.  
**Applied tools:** data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, hypothesis testing. 
**Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scipy.  
**Results:** apparently users on PC and XOne give similar scores in average.
