# Well  
**Selecting a location for an oil well**  
**Aim:** To build a reliable model to make profit-based decisions.  
**Description:** A set of geographical and geochemical data related to oil mining is given for several areas. After preprocessing the data, it is necessary to predict which are more likely to be profitable if several wells will be made there. For this purpose, linear regression was chosen as reliable model for quantitative data-based predictions. Bootstrap allowed to target the best option for mining.  
**Applied tools:** data pre-processing, visualization, linear regression, bootstrap.  
**Libraries:** pandas, maplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scipy, sklearn.  
**Results:** Careful usage of the aforementioned techniques allowed to select statistically validated location.
