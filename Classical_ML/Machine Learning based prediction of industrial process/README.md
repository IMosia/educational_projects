Machine Learning based prediction of industrial process  
**Recovering gold from ore**  
**Aim:** A machine-learning-based approach for the prediction of the outcome of a complex chemical industry process.  
**Description:** A big dataset (87 columns) of physicochemical parameters was preprocessed: outliners, duplicates, data types, missing values were handled. Based on graphical approach the data was additionally analyzed to determine trends in features and parameters. Several models were trained based on different parameters’ sets, namely: linear regression, decision tree, and random forest with hyperparameters’ optimization. Model predictions were analyzed as well as parameters input, the best models were chosen.
**Applied tools:** data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, linear regression, decision tree, random forest, parameters input analysis.  
**Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, skipy, sklearn, shap.  
**Results:** Based on pre-processed data reliable machine learning algorithms were trained.
