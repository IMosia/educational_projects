Math for safe data usage in ML  
**Protection of personal data of clients**  
**Aim:** To encode personal data and ensure that encoding does not harm machine learning.  
**Description:** An approach based on the multiplication of parameter matrix onto randomly generated matrix was tested. With rigorous mathematical proof in hand an algorithm was tested: a random matrix was generated, new encoded parameters were obtained and a quality of linear regression trained on initial and encoded parameters was compared.  
**Applied tools:** manipulation with matrix, linear regression.  
**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, sklearn.  
**Results:** It was shown mathematically and proven empirically that the proposed encoding does not harm machine learning.
