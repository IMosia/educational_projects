Machine Learning forecast of cab orders.  
**Forecasting cab orders**  
**Aim:** To build a Machine learning-based algorithm to forecast future cab demand.  
**Description:** A dataset containing only historical data on orders per time was analyzed on regularity and trends, and autocorrelation was studied to generate reliable parameters for machine learning. A series of various machine learning algorithms was tested for the forecast task, linear regression was found to be the best. In addition, the influence of generated parameters was tested on machine learning outcomes and found to be neglectable in this case.  
**Applied tools:** time-series analysis, exploratory data analysis, linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and parameters generation.  
**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn, time.  
**Results:** Linear regression model with RMSE of 34.4 (required at max 48) showed the best results for predicting users’ activity.
