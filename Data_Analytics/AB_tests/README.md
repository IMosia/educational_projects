The learning project involves understanding A/A and A/B testing methodologies through practical simulations and analysis. 

### A/A Testing
In the A/A testing section, we aim to verify the correctness of our split system by conducting multiple tests and observing the distribution of p-values. We simulate 10,000 A/A tests, each involving sampling 500 users from two experimental groups and comparing them using t-tests.

### A/B Testing
In the A/B testing segment, we analyze an experiment conducted with data science peers. We examine CTR differences between control and experimental groups using various statistical tests such as t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and bootstrap methods. Additionally, we explore a novel approach suggested by Yandex researchers for analyzing metrics ratios, focusing on the linearized likes metric.

Tasks include:
- Visualizing p-value distributions
- Determining significant differences between groups
- Providing recommendations based on the analysis

The project integrates practical application with theoretical concepts and encourages critical thinking in interpreting test results. The project concludes with a comprehensive understanding of testing methodologies, including their limitations and applications in real-world scenarios.
