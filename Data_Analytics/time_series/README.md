### Analyzing a News Feed Flashmob and Forecasting User Activity

#### Analyzing the News Feed Flashmob

As a student delving into data analysis, I had the opportunity to evaluate the impact of a news feed flashmob organized by our marketing team. The flashmob aimed to increase user engagement by encouraging participants to share interesting facts about themselves. Three posts with the most likes stood to win prizes.

1. **Identifying Metrics:**
    - I speculated on which metrics were likely to change during the flashmob and why. I hypothesized several metrics anticipating shifts in user engagement and interaction.

2. **Verifying Metric Changes:**
    - To assess the impact, I utilized CausalImpact to examine if the predicted metric changes occurred. I delved into how the metrics actually shifted and by what margin, providing insights into the effectiveness of the flashmob.

3. **Long-term Effects:**
    - I pondered over whether the flashmob had any enduring effects on user behavior.

#### Forecasting User Activity

In another aspect of my data analysis journey, I embarked on predicting changes in user activity over the upcoming month to address server load issues and app freezes.

1. **Selecting Primary Metric:**
    - I carefully deliberated on the primary metric for forecasting, justifying my choice based on its relevance to user engagement dynamics.

2. **Model Construction and Validation:**
    - I constructed and validated the forecasting model, considering the availability of data. I determined the suitability for backtesting and identified the horizon for reliable forecasts.

3. **Model Selection and Interpretation:**
    - I evaluated different forecasting models and justified my selection based on performance and interpretability. With each model, I interpreted the results, acknowledging any limitations in the analysis.
