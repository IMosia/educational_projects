### Developing an Airflow DAG for an Enhanced ETL Task: My Experience

I took on the challenge of building a sophisticated Airflow DAG for an advanced ETL task. The goal was to create a DAG that runs daily to process data from the previous day.

1. **Parallel Processing of Two Tables:**
    - I implemented parallel processing for two tables: `feed_actions` and `message_actions`. For each user in `feed_actions`, I computed the number of content views and likes. Similarly, for each user in `message_actions`, I calculated the number of received and sent messages, as well as the count of unique users they interacted with. Each extraction was handled in a separate task.

2. **Table Integration:**
    - I merged the two tables into a single unified table.

3. **Metrics Calculation by Gender, Age, and OS:**
    - For the unified table, I computed all metrics based on gender, age, and operating system (OS). I created three different tasks for each dimension slice.

4. **Storing Final Data in ClickHouse:**
    - I ensured that the final dataset, containing all computed metrics, was stored in a dedicated table within the ClickHouse database.

5. **Daily Data Updates:**
    - I configured the DAG to append new data to the table every day.

**Table Structure:**
- Date: `event_date`
- Dimension Name: `dimension`
- Dimension Value: `dimension_value`
- Views Count: `views`
- Likes Count: `likes`
- Received Messages Count: `messages_received`
- Sent Messages Count: `messages_sent`
- Users Who Sent Messages: `users_received`
- Users Who Received Messages: `users_sent`

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in orchestrating complex ETL workflows using Airflow, manipulating data, and ensuring its seamless integration into the ClickHouse database. This task challenged me to apply my data engineering skills and problem-solving abilities in a real-world scenario.
